# Raisume: Smart Skillsistant that Identifies and Infers Skills from Resumes

Human Resources (HR) recruiters play a pivotal role in selecting and hiring the right candidates to drive company growth. This task is challenging, as recruiters must quickly strategize and fill open positions while managing the interview process with hiring managers (TalentEdge, 2024). Additionally, recruiters face the daunting task of sifting through an average of 250 applications for every job opening (Glassdoor, 2016), making the selection process even more demanding. Furthermore, recruiters face difficulties in finding candidates that possess skills that matches with the job description. (Godbersen, 2023)

To address these challenges, we developed Raisume, or Rais, an Azure AI-powered application designed to streamline the resume filtering process for HR professionals.

## Use Cases

### Summarise Skills Written in Resumes

Rais intelligently identifies and extracts skill keywords from resumes, presenting them in a concise, readable tabular format. Recruiters simply upload resumes into Rais, and the app handles the rest, eliminating the need for manual keyword searches.

Rais achieves this by first using Azure's Document Intelligence to convert resumes into text format. This text is then passed to Azure CosmosDB, which searches for contextual data. Finally, the text and contextual data are fed into Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo, which identifies and extracts all relevant skills.

### Answer Queries Related to Skills

Rais also functions as a smart assistant, capable of answering questions about skills. In the fast-changing job market, HR recruiters may struggle to keep up with emerging trends and technical jargon. With Rais, recruiters can ask questions to clarify these terms, helping them assess their relevance to specific roles.

Azure CosmosDB maintains a dynamic database of relevant skills, which serves as a grounding data source, providing contextual knowledge to Rais. The core of Rais's functionality is powered by Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo, which uses the recruiterâ€™s queries and the contextual knowledge from Azure CosmosDB to deliver precise and relevant responses.

## System Design

We utilised the following resources and datasets for Raisume:
- Azure App Services to seamlessly host updated versions of Raisume, built with Streamlit, with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Azure Document Intelligence (layout model) to accurately extract plain text from documents
- Skills Dataset (from Skill Extractor Cognitive Search) as documents for the RAG: https://github.com/microsoft/SkillsExtractorCognitiveSearch/blob/master/data/skills.json
- Azure Cosmos DB, as a RAG, to store skills from the Skills Dataset, generate embeddings for each skill and perform vector searches for prompts/documents
- Azure OpenAI (ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo 16k) to identify and infer skills from the prompt, results from the RAG and chat context

## Functionalities

### Resume Analyser

The resume analyser is the front page of the Streamlit application, allowing users to upload a resume supported by Azure AI Document Intelligence, and utilising ChatGPT on Azure OpenAI to extract and identify skills stated and described in the resume respectively.

Firstly, to parse documents, the Azure AI Document Intelligence Python SDK for the (prebuilt) layout model is used. This allows us to control how the parsed text is being fed to ChatGPT - the document can be segmented into multiple subheadings and paragraphs, where we ensured each paragrah starts with a new line and that there is an empty line before each subheading.

Secondly, to help guide ChatGPT on the what to expect - and most importantly what the output should be like - the prompt engineering technique by Jeff Su is utilised, which comprises of six key components: Task, Context, Exemplars, Persona, Format, and Tone. (Su, 2023) Other than the tone component, we used these elements to create our first system prompt for all resume uploads. To ensure that ChatGPT returns a JSON object, `{'type': 'json_object'}` argument is being passed to the `response_format` parameter in `chat.completions.create()`.

Thirdly, to guide the LLM towards identifying and inferring relevant skills, we utilised Cosmos DB as a RAG to retrieve relevant skills by using the resume content as the query. The skills dataset is preloaded and embedded, prior to performing a vector search to extract the 50 most similar skills in the MongoDB database. The results are then passed as a system prompt after the user prompt.

Lastly, to validate ChatGPT's response, the response is being decoded using `json.loads()`. If the response is not a valid JSON, the Completions API will be called again.

```python
if isinstance(response_format, dict) and response_format['type'] == 'json_object':
        # Check if valid json
        num_retries = 0
        valid_json = False
        while (not valid_json) and (num_retries <= 3):
            response_message = response.choices[0].message.content
            try:
                json.loads(response_message)
                valid_json = ('skills' in response_message) and ('predicted_skills' in response_message)
            except ValueError:
                # Get another response
                num_retries += 1
                response = get_llm_response(chat_client, messages, response_format, stream)
```

### Chat

The chat feature in Rais is similar to many implementations of generative AI applications, allowing users to freely enter text and receive a response from the LLM. Similar to resume analyser, we utilised the five (out of six) components by Jeff Su to create our first system prompt for all chat instances. However, we only requested ChatGPT to include the skills tables (identified and inferred) in Markdown format, but did not validate the response as it is unstructured.

Next, vector search is being performed on the RAG (elaborated in the previous section: Resume Analyser).

Lastly, to show the response in real time, `stream=True` is passed into `chat.completions.create()`, along with all the chat history in `messages`.

### Chat History

The chat history page displays all messages, from both the resume analyser and chat, in one page. This allows the user to look through all their interactions with ChatGPT, along with the engineered system prompts and RAG results.

## Challenges Faced

- MongoDB cursor auto closing
- SKU S0
- Error 422 invalid string (Langchain)
- Error 500 from ChatGPT
- Tokens exceeded

## Future Work
**Resume and Job Description Matching & Analytics**

Future enhancements for Rais include capabilities for resume and job description matching and advanced analytics. By leveraging Azure CosmosDB to store resumes and job descriptions, Rais can be further developed to filter applicants for specific roles or groups of similar roles. Additionally, Rais can perform trend and demographic analysis on applicant data, providing valuable insights for HR departments.

**Applicant-Facing Features**

Rais can be expanded to assist applicants in finding the open job roles most relevant to their resumes, eliminating the need to browse through the company hiring portal. Moreover, Rais can answer any questions applicants may have about job descriptions and the company itself, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
